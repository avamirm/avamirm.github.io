Hello, Iâ€™m Ava, a last year Computer Engineering B.Sc. student at ECE Department at the University of Tehran. My interests lie in software verification, programming languages, and distributed systems. I am currently working on my bachelor's thesis on the topic of verifying privacy bugs on social media, supervised by <a href="https://www.fatemehghassemi.ir/">Prof. Fatemeh Ghassemi</a>.

Non-Academic Interests
======

In addition to my passion for technology, I have a deep love for psychology. I like finding out how the human mind works and how we can improve our mental health. I also find it interesting to figure out how our childhood affects our adult life.
